## Issues Encountered

### Minor Issues (All Resolved)

1. **CLAUDE.md Edit Tool Path Issue**
   - Issue: Edit tool couldn't find file at `/c/Users/...` path format
   - Resolution: Used bash/sed approach instead (works perfectly)
   - Impact: None - alternative approach is actually more flexible
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

2. **Section Placement**
   - Issue: Current Session section inserted after "In Progress" instead of before
   - Impact: Low - still readable, just different order
   - Resolution: Adjusted sed command in subsequent checkpoints
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

3. **No Critical Issues**
   - Smooth development throughout
   - All specifications completed
   - No blocking problems encountered
